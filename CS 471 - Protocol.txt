Our plan for the project is to divide the code into 3 sections with get, put, and ls. By focusing on these three portions we’re focusing on only the client and server side portions. Above in the application layer protocol are the ideas that our code could run should we choose too. This allows us to route the proper ports and begin the initial transfers required for each command.
